<h1> TYPES OF WASTE</h1>
<P>Waste is any unwanted or unusable material that is discarded after it has served its purpose.
It can be solid, liquid, or gas, and can also be referred to as trash, garbage, rubbish, or junk. 
Waste can come from many sources, including:
Homes: Household garbage, such as old food, paper, broken furniture, and used containers 
Schools and workplaces: Civil waste, such as waste from schools and workplaces 
Industries and production lines: Modern waste, such as industrial effluents, batteries, and electronics 
Construction and demolition: Construction and demolition waste (C&D) includes materials such as brick, drywall, metal, cardboard, doors, and windows 
In India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change estimates that the country generates 62 million tons of waste every year. 
The majority of this waste is organic, plastic, paper, glass, metal, and hazardous waste.

<h2>SOLID WASTE</h2>
<p>Solid waste is any discarded material, such as garbage, sludge, or other waste from homes, businesses, and industrial, commercial, mining, agricultural, or community activities. It can be a solid, semisolid, liquid, or contained gas. 
Solid waste can be categorized by where it is generated, such as municipal solid waste (MSW), health care waste, or e-waste. MSW is commonly called trash or garbage and includes items like food, paper, plastics, textiles, leather, wood, glass, and metals. 
Solid waste can be hazardous or nonhazardous. Reactive waste is unstable and can undergo violent reactions when exposed to heat, pressure, or water. Examples of reactive waste include explosives, cyanide-containing waste, and some pharmaceuticals. 
Solid waste can come from many sources, including:
Construction sites, such as new construction sites, road repair sites, building renovation sites, and building demolition sites
Municipal services, such as street cleaning, wastes from parks and beaches, wastewater treatment plants, landscaping wastes, and wastes from recreational areas
Treatment plants and sites, such as refineries, power plants, processing plants, mineral extraction plants, and chemicals plants
Agriculture, such as crop farms, orchards, dairies, vineyards, and feedlots. </p>

How Can You Manage And Treat Industrial Wastewater? - Membracon
Industrial waste is any material that is no longer usable after being produced in a factory, mill, or mining operation. It can be solid, semi-solid, or liquid, and can be hazardous or non-hazardous. 
Some examples of industrial waste include:
Dirt and gravel,
Masonry and concrete,
Scrap metal,
Oil,
Solvents,
Chemicals,
Scrap lumber,
Vegetable matter from restaurants. 
Industrial waste can pollute soil and water bodies, including lakes, streams, rivers, and coastal waters. It can also contaminate groundwater. 
Some industries that produce industrial waste include:
Chemical manufacturers,
Produce organic-compound containing wastewater, reactive waste, acids, and bases ,
Printing industry,
Produces solid and liquid waste, including sludges containing heavy metals, waste inks, and solvents 
Leather industry,
Produces toxic industrial wastewater and solid waste in the form of tanned and non-tanned hide ,
Most countries have legislation to deal with industrial waste, but enforcement can be an issue.</P>

<h2>HOUSEHOLD WASTE</h2>

<p>Household waste is any waste that comes from a household, including:
Rubbish ,
Unwanted or unusable items like old furniture, mattresses, or electrical items, 
Food scraps, fruits, vegetables, paper, cans, bottles, clothes, chocolate wrappers, shampoo bottles, and sachets, 
Household waste can be non-hazardous or hazardous. Non-hazardous waste can be recycled, while hazardous waste can harm the environment and human health if not disposed of properly.
Examples of hazardous waste include: batteries, garage oils, and home cleaners. 
Improper disposal of household waste can lead to: Air pollution, Contamination of groundwater, and Landfills.</p>

<h2>MEDICAL WASTE</h2>

<p>Medical waste is any waste generated by health care activities, including:
Used needles and syringes, Soiled dressings, Body parts, Diagnostic samples, Blood, Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Medical devices, and Radioactive materials. 
Medical waste can be hazardous and can contain:
Dangerous microorganisms, Toxic drugs, Radiological hazard, Sharp objects, Sewage, and Toxic elements or compounds. 
Poor management of medical waste can lead to: Infections, Toxic effects, Injuries, and Environmental pollution. 
It's important to dispose of medical waste correctly to:
Reduce the risks of human infection,
Reduce the spread of infectionscs,
Ensure that the final stage of medical waste is safe. </p>

<h2>REDIOACTIVE WASTE</h2>

<p>Radioactive waste is material that contains radioactive materials and has no foreseeable use: 
It can be in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas 
It can remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years 
It is generated from a variety of activities, including medical, industrial, research, and agricultural practices 
Nuclear energy is the most important source of radioactive waste because of the large volumes generated and its long-lived nature 
Nuclear Waste Treatment: An Overview
Radioactive waste is categorized based on its radioactivity content and its half-life, which is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms to decay. 
The three main categories are low-level waste (LLW), intermediate-level waste (ILW), and high-level waste (HLW). 
Radioactive waste must be managed safely and economically. The activities involved in managing radioactive waste include: Minimizing the amounts created,
Conditioning and packaging to permit safe handling and protection during transport, Interim storage, and Final disposal.
