<h1> WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL</h1>
<p >There are several ways to manage waste, including reducing, reusing, recycling, and composting: 
Reduce: Reduce the amount of waste you create by using reusable items, buying products with less packaging, and buying secondhand. 
Reuse: Find new ways to use items, such as donating, reselling, or repurposing them. 
Recycle: Recycle waste products to create new products. 
Compost: Bury organic waste in a pit to make compost or manure. 
Incineration: Burn organic waste at a high temperature to reduce it to ash and waste gas. 
Landfills: Take waste to a remote location and dispose of it in a low-lying area. 
Sewage treatment: Clean wastewater before releasing it into natural water bodies. 
Waste management team: Establish a team of responsible employees to take charge of waste management. 
You can also consider these tips:
Assess your household waste. 
Sort and segregate your waste. 
Handle hazardous waste with care. 
Opt for sustainable products. 
Monitor waste disposal. 
Educate and influence others. 
Pay your bills online to reduce paper waste. 
Ask your banks and other sources to send you e-statements or e-bills.</p>

<h2> HOW TO MANAGE SOLID WASTE</h2>

<p id="h"> Solid waste management involves collecting, segregating, storing, transporting, processing, and disposing of solid waste.</p>
<p>
<b >Here are some ways to manage solid waste:</b><br> 
<b>Reduce waste:</b>Be mindful of purchases and choose products with minimal packaging.<br>
<b>Segregate waste:</b>Sort waste into categories like organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable. <br>
<b>Compost organic waste:</b> Use a compost bin for food scraps and yard waste to create nutrient-rich soil for plants.<br> 
<b>Recycle: </b>Separate, process, and reuse materials from solid waste. Recycling reduces the need for raw materials, energy usage, and greenhouse gas emissions.<br> 
<b>E-waste management:</b> Collect e-waste, recover and recycle material, and dispose of e-waste using safe methods.<br> 
<b>Waste minimization:</b> Reduce solid waste through source reduction and process optimization.
Source reduction involves changing manufacturing processes to reduce waste generation</br></p>

<h2> HOW TO MANAGE INDUSTRIAL WASTE </h2>
<p id="h">Industrial waste management aims to reduce the negative impact of industrial waste on the environment and human health. </p>
<p> Here are some ways to manage industrial waste:<br> 

<b>Segregation</b> 
Sort and separate waste into different types to enable recycling and proper disposal. <br>

<b>Recycling</b> 
Some waste materials can be recycled to make new items.<br> 

<b>Composting</b> 
Convert organic waste into fertilizer that can be used to improve soil quality. <br>

<b>Landfills</b> 
Bury biodegradable industrial waste in landfills to generate electricity from the released bio-gases. <br>

<b>Incineration</b> 
Reduce the toxicity and volume of waste before disposing of it in landfills. <br>

<b>Sustainable waste management</b>
Use fewer materials, keep materials in the value chain for as long as possible, and minimize waste going to landfill. <br>

<b>Zero waste manufacturing</b> 
Develop manufacturing technologies and systems to support countries transition to a circular economy. <br>
<b>Other best practices for industrial waste management include:</b> 
Training employees in waste management practices
Using licensed transporters for hazardous waste
Constantly gauging waste management practices.<br></p>

<h2>HOW TO MANAGE HOUSEHOLD WASTE</h2>
<p id="h">Household waste is any waste that comes from a household, including:
Rubbish 
Unwanted or unusable items like old furniture, mattresses, or electrical items 
Food scraps, fruits, vegetables, paper, cans, bottles, clothes, chocolate wrappers, shampoo bottles, and sachets </p>
<p>
<b>Reduce waste:</b> Buy foods with less packaging, avoid single-use containers, and use reusable bags and bottles.
You can also reduce paper use by using cloth rags instead of paper towels, and by buying e-books instead of hard copies.<br> 
<b>Reuse:</b>Use reusable lunch containers, washable snack bags, and reusable grocery bags. You can also use reusable rags and cloths for cleaning. <br> 
<b>Recycle:</b> Recycle what you can and purchase wisely. <br> 
<b>Compost:</b> Compost food waste that's no longer suitable for consumption. <br> 
<b>Donate:</b> Donate used goods to charity shops. <br> 
<b>Dispose of electronics responsibly:</b> Dispose of electronics in a responsible manner. <br> 
<b>Segregate waste:</b> Separate degradable waste from non-degradable waste. <br> 
<b>Use less water:</b> Turn off taps when not in use, take shorter showers, and hand wash dishes if you only need to clean a few. </p><br>

<h2>HOW TO MANAGE MEDICAL WASTE</h2>
<p><b>Segregation</b>
Separate waste by its type and the substances it contains. Use dedicated bags that are the color required by the health facility's local regulations. </br>
<b>Labeling</b>
Label containers with the type of waste, the origin department and agency, the date of disposal, and whether Halibox is present. </br>
<b>Tight sealing</b>
Ensure that the canisters and plastic containers that hold the waste are tightly sealed. <br>
<b>Autoclaving</b>
Use pressurized steam to kill infectious agents and denature proteins.</br>
<b>Chemical methods</b>
Use chemicals like sodium hypochlorite, dissolved chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, dry inorganic chemical, and ozone to disinfect. </br>
<b>Waste audits</b>
Conduct regular audits to ensure that medical waste is being disposed of correctly. </br>
<b>Digitalization</b>
Use IoT technologies to monitor waste and medical waste management in real time. 
Environmental Management Group
Consider establishing a dedicated Environmental Management Group (EMG).

<h2>HOW TO MANAGE REDIOACTIVE WASTE </h2>

<p>Radioactive waste management involves a series of steps, including:</br>
<b>Planning and preparation</b>
Reducing the amount of waste produced and planning how to manage it before it arises.<br>
<b>Treatment</b>
Depending on the type of waste and disposal route, this could include decontaminating, shredding, compacting, drying, or solidifying.<br>
<b>Packaging </b>
Radioactive waste is packaged in specially engineered containers for safe storage and disposal.<br>
<b>Storage</b>
Interim facilities store waste until a suitable disposal route is available. <br>
<b>Disposal</b>
Waste is placed into engineered facilities where it will remain permanently.<br> 
<b>Some other considerations for radioactive waste management include:</b>
Minimizing waste: Waste management plants use processes and technologies to reduce the volume of waste 
Regulatory control: Radioactive materials are subject to regulatory control 
Storage time: High-level waste is often stored for about 50 years before disposal 
Disposal location: Deep geological disposal is considered the best solution for the most radioactive waste 
Future generations: Radioactive waste should be managed so that it doesn't impose undue burdens on future generation <br></p>
