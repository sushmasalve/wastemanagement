<h2> History of waste</h2>
<p>Waste management has been a concern for human civilizations throughout history.
 The earliest known wastewater management system dates back to around 6500 BCE in present-day Syria, featurin
g sophisticated gutter systems and settling chambers. 
Ancient civilizations like the Roman Empire developed complex waste removal systems, including the Cloaca Maxima, which emptied into the Tiber River. 
The Maya of Central America had monthly rituals for burning garbage. However, access to these early waste management systems was often limited to higher socioeconomic classes.
The Industrial Revolution led to a rapid deterioration of sanitation in urban areas, 
particularly in England. The first organized solid waste management system appeared in London in the late 18th century with 
the 'dust-yards' system. In the mid-19th century, Edwin Chadwick's report on sanitary conditions spurred legislation like the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act 1846. The first incinerator was built in Nottingham in 1874, despite initial opposition. New York City became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management in 1895. Early garbage removal trucks were horse-drawn, later evolving into motorized vehicles with hydraulic compactors by the 1930s.

<h2>WASTE PRODUCTION DUE TO CIVILIZATION</h2>
<p>Waste production is a result of civilization and is increasing globally. Here are some facts about waste production: <br>
<b>Global waste generation:-</b>
The world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually, and this is expected to increase to 3.40 billion tonnes
 by 2050.<br> 
<b>Waste generation per person:-</b>
The average amount of waste generated per person per day is 0.74 kilograms, but this varies widely. <br>
<b>Waste generation by income level:-</b>
High-income countries generate about 34% of the world's waste, despite only accounting for 16% of the world's population. <br>
<b>Waste management in India:-</b>
India is one of the world's top 10 countries generating municipal solid waste. In 2020, India generated 62 million tonnes of 
waste annually, and it's predicted to increase to 165 million tonnes by 2030. <br></p>
